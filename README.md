# What did I learned by doing this project

# 1. Why do we need to import React from "react" in our in our files?

Because the jsx syntax is defined in React

# 2. If I were to console.log page in index.js what would show up?

Javascript {object}. These are React elements the describe what React should eventually add to the real DOM for us

# 3. What is wrong with this code?

```javacript
  const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website</p>
  )
```

ans: We need our jsx to be wrapped inside a single parent element

# 4. What does it mean for something to be declarative instead of imparative?

- declarative: means that i can tell the computer what to do and expect it to handle the details
- imperative: means that i need to tell it how to do each step

# 5. What does it mean for something to be composible

We have small pieces that we can put together to something larger/ greater than the indevidual pieces

# 6. What is a react component?

A function that return React elements. A component can be reused over and over

# 7. What is wrong with below code?

```javascript
function myComponent() {
  return <small>Im tiny</small>;
